# StockApp
A quick example of how to parse the Yahoo! Finance API in a Swift app to access stock data.

## How to customize the software

### Yahoo! Finance API
The API is accessed using an NSURL call where the result is in JSON format. To add your own stock(s), simply edit the query within the hyperlink (this example is only showing data from the stock ticker EFFI).

Printing the variable jsonResult after it's instantiated will give you an undersanding of how to access the data you chose to query and store.

Please ask questions if you need help using this.
